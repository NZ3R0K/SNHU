----------------------------------------------------- PLAY -----------------------------------------------------
- A player rolls 6 dice to get points.
- Any combination of points listed above (known as point dice) can be placed aside to cash.
- Any remaining dice can be rerolled for more points, 
  or the player can end the turn to cash any points gained and add it to their final score.
- At least 1 score dice must be kept to reroll.
- If there are no score dice then all points gained that turn will be lost - this is a FARKLE.
- The player must cash 500 points in one turn to get on the scoreboard,
  any amount of points may be cashed in a turn after getting on the scoreboard.
- The first player to reach 10,000 points wins the game, 
  every other player gets 1 turn to beat that score and take first place.
