Requirements:
- At least 2 players



Points:
    5   = 50 points
    1   = 100 points
(3) 2's = 200 points
(3) 3's = 300 points
(3) 4's = 400 points
(3) 5's = 500 points
(3) 1's = 1000 points



Play:
The current player rolls 6 dice and puts aside any "point dice" (1's, 5's, three of a kind) that appear. 
The player may choose at this point to either cash the points and add it to their final score - thus ending their turn, 
or roll the remaining dice to collect more points.
A Farkle may occur when no point dice appear. 
When this occurs the player loses any points collected during the turn and the player's turn ends with no points being collected.
If all 6 dice are point dice the sum of the faces will be recorded and all 6 dice can be rolled again for more points. 
The recorded value is not added to the score until the player chooses to cash the points and thus can be lost by a Farkle.



Entering:
In order to be placed on the scoreboard, the player must cash at least 500 points in a single turn.
The player will be locked out of cashing any points less than 500 until 500 points is cashed.
Once the player has cashed at least 500 points they will be placed on the scoreboard.
After a player is placed on the scoreboard they may cash any amount of points during a turn without restraint


Winning:
In order to win the game a player must achieve 10,000 points cashed on the scoreboard,
at which point the other players will have one more turn to get more points to beat the set score. 
If no players are able to achieve more points then the winner is declared. 
If the score is beat then the new player wins the game.
